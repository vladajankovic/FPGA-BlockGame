# FPGA-BlockGame
# BlockGame created in Quartus for FPGA that combines PS/2 Mouse protocol and VGA protocol

Using complete models of components, such as registers, clock dividers, ALU, ... my partner and i created a game that is based on the "Move the Block" slide puzzle.
The blicks are moved using the mouse by clicking and draging, and when the required block is freed, an arrow apears that, when clicked on, changes the screen to a new level.
We created 4 levels to test the functionality of the game with 2 easy levels and 2 chalenging levels.
The game works on a Cyclone 3 FPGA, whose documentation can be found using the following link:

The documentatin that is presented with this project is in Serbian language.
